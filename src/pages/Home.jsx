      Zero Projects is a consulting firm that helps make technology simple again .The <strong>science</strong> of building complex systems is also the <strong>art</strong> of breaking hard problems down into simple, interchangeable parts. Complex systems in a  language like <strong>Javascript</strong> are made up of parts that are individually testable  and maintainable, yet composable and reusable.
