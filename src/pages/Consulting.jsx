      have the knowledge and expertise to help your business evolve through the toughest of

    <h3>For Startups</h3>
    <p>
      If you're a <strong>startup</strong> and need help building or growing an MVP, we can help. If you need
      assistance in building or training a team, or installing best practices, we can help there as well.
      If you're <strong>migrating a Rails or Java app</strong> to Node.js, or vice versa, our developers are highly skilled in
      multiple languages (that's right, <strong>we're not just Javascript developers</strong>) and can help see you
      through the transition.
    </p>

    <h3>For Corporations</h3>
    <p>If you're in a <strong>large corporate</strong> setting, and need a reliable team who can help quickly deliver 
    on promises, we're your guys. Tight deadlines are no problem for us. We can also <strong>train your team</strong> to
    work with Javascript more effectively. We also really shine when it comes to proof of concept (<strong>POC</strong>) work.
    We make sure everything we write is reusable, maintainable and documented.
