    <h1>We work your way.</h1>

    <p></p>

    <h3>For Startups & Ventures</h3>
    <p>
      If you're a <strong>startup</strong> and need help building or growing an MVP, we can help. If you need
      assistance in building or training a team, or installing best practices, we can help there as well.
      If you're <strong>migrating a Rails or Java app</strong> to Node.js, or vice versa, our developers are highly skilled in
      multiple languages (that's right, <strong>we're not just Javascript developers</strong>) and can help see you
      through the transition.
    </p>

    <h3>For Corporations & SMBs</h3>
    <p>
      If you're in a <strong>large corporate</strong> setting, and need a reliable team who can help quickly deliver 
      <strong> robust business systems</strong>, we're your guys. Tight deadlines are no problem for us. We can also <strong>train your team</strong> to
      work with Javascript more effectively. We also really shine when it comes to proof of concept (<strong>POC</strong>) work.
      We make sure everything we write is reusable, maintainable and documented.
    </p>

    <h3>For Government & Public Sector</h3>
    <p>
      If you work in the <strong>government</strong> or in <strong>public sector organizations</strong>, we can help you
      leverage the tried-and-tested ecosystem of technologies and web frameworks that Javascript represents. We excel
      in building <strong>responsive UI</strong> experiences that meet <strong>accessibility standards</strong> within budget
      and on time.
    </p>

    <h3>For Non-Profits & Charities</h3>
    <p>
      We work with charities, non-profits and social enterprises to help them serve their donors and customers better.
      Web-based user interfaces offer a world of options in <strong>engagement, outreach and fundraising</strong>. We
      can design and develop software for <strong>mobile devices and tablets</strong> that can make fundraising easier
      and more efficient.
