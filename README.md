# Zero Projects Website

### Notes
`yarn` is used throughout the documentation; however, you may use `npm` as a 1:1 replacement for every command.

### Dependencies
For an easier development flow, it's recommended to install `hexo-cli` by running `npm install -g hexo-cli`.

### Setup
To setup the environment, clone the repository and run `yarn install` within the root.
Once finished, you can now run `yarn build` to build the blog or `yarn serve` to build and serve the website locally.
