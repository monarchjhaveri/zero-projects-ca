### Notes
`yarn` is used throughout the documentation; however, you may use `npm` as a 1:1 replacement for every command.

### Dependencies
For an easier development flow, it's recommended to install `hexo-cli` by running `npm install -g hexo-cli`.

### Setup
To setup the environment, clone the repository and run `yarn install` within the root.

### Development
For easier blog development, run `hexo server` within the `/blog` folder to host & watch the blog files.

### Commands
##### $ yarn build
Build the Hexo blog which will output all the static files needed for the blog to `/public`

##### $ yarn serve
Will build and then serve the `/public` folder to a local server.
